I'm always looking for new challenges that involve developing new skills related to data science. Highly data savvy, I have gained extensive hard skills (machine learning, statistical inference, programming) and soft skills (project management, communication) resulting in eight publications in highly ranked scientific journals.

If you are looking for a team player, a dedicated and productive member for your data science team, I am a self-motivated individual and believe I would be a valuable contribution for the right position.
