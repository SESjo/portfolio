# "A variety of experiences yields new perspectives"

Always looking for new challenges that involve developing new skills, I have a diverse set of experiences both in industry and academia. Highly data savvy, I have acquired hard skills (machine learning, statistical inference, programming) and soft skills (project management, communication) that have allowed me to cope with any kind of work environment

If you are looking for a team player, a dedicated and productive member for your team, I am a self-motivated individual and believe I would be a valuable contribution to the right position.

Key Achievements include:

-   the implementation of a self-service business intelligence approach with the Tableau product suite
